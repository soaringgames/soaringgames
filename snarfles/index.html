                            Your box will come full of custom designed, 3d printed models. Let's take a look inside, shall we?

                            This is Snarfles. He's at the top of the food chain, and he eats...well, everything. A turn counter at his feet keeps track of where you are in your journey, but watch out for coming storms!
                        </p>

                            Additionally, there are a wide variety of biomes, each with their own sets of rules. For instance, here's the forest biome, the area where life multiplies quickly.
                        </p>

                            Here's the mountains, a safe haven for bunnies who can climb to escape the predators.
                        </p>
                        <img src="IMG_3930.png" alt="Mountain biome" class="img-fluid mb-3">
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Each biome is fully modular, allowing you to create new boards which unlock their own possibilities.
                        </p>

                            Experiment with different layouts, or try picking completely randomly! You never know what the world of Snarfles may throw at you...

                            Be careful of water, it's impossible to cross...our poor bunnies are separated!
                        </p>

                            Never mind, the ice has frozen over! It's safe to cross now, just do it quickly...
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            With Snarfles himself, 6 predators, 8 bunnies, 12 grass, and 11 biomes, the possibilities are endless.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            5 months ago, Kaitlyn and I designed the first prototype for this game, going through several iterations of design until we had something special. Not only is Snarfles extremely fun to play due to the changing landscape, unique strategy, and looming storms, but it also subtly points towards a deeper message.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Oftentimes life throws us curveballs that make us question: God, do you really know what you're doing? While not explicitly stated in the game's design, there's a sense in which Snarfles gives you a chance to "play God", and to ponder that question. How much pain would you be willing to endure if you could see the world as God sees it? It's not a question you have to answer, the game is light-hearted and enjoyed casually, but it's there if you want it to be.
